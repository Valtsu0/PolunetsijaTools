				"Örkkis are forged in the fires of violence and conflict, often from the moment they are born. As they live lives that are frequently cut brutally short, Örkkis revel in testing their strength against worthy foes, whether by challenging a higher-ranking member of their community for dominance or raiding a neighboring settlement. Many Örkkis seek glory as soon as they can walk and carry a blade or club, taming wild beasts or hunting deadly monsters."

			"info": [
				"Örkkis often struggle to gain acceptance among other communities, who frequently see them as brutes. Those who earn the loyalty of an Örkki friend, however, soon learn that an Örkki's fidelity and honesty are unparalleled. Örkki barbarians, fighters, and rangers are prized as gladiators and mercenaries. While some human settlements might be hesitant to accept an entire Örkki community into their midst, a small handful of Örkki mercenaries can do the job of an entire squad of human conscripts, so long as the Örkkis are well fed and well paid. Though the belief that Örkkis are only suited for battle is pervasive among other humanoids, the harsh Örkki mentality comes from a long history of conflict rather than a lack of ability in other areas.",
				"Örkki culture teaches that they are shaped by the challenges they survive, and the most worthy survive the most hardships. Örkkis who attain both a long life and great triumphs command immense respect.",
				"If you want a character who is hardy, fearsome, and excels at feats of physical prowess, you should play an Örkki.",

						"Örkkis are tall and powerfully built, with long arms and stocky legs. Many Örkkis top 7 feet in height, though they tend to adopt broad, almost bow-legged stances and slouch forward at the shoulders. The combination makes for a seeming contradiction, sharing an eye level with most humanoids while simultaneously towering over them. Örkkis have rough skin, thick bones, and rockhard muscles, making them suited to war and other physically demanding tasks. Despite the roughness of their skin, Örkkis scar easily, and most Örkkis take great pride in the scars they have accumulated. Örkki skin color is typically green and occasionally gray, though some Örkkis have other skin colors that reflect adaptations to their environments.",
						"Örkkis consider powerful builds and heavily scarred skin attractive, regardless of gender. A powerful Örkki makes the hold stronger, and scars are signs of victories won or hardships survived. Similarly, many Örkkis consider large, jutting tusks to be more attractive than smaller tusks, since the former make more effective weapons. Many Örkkis also find tattoos to be attractive, particularly large or painful ones that cover a significant amount of skin."

						"Most Örkki communities define themselves through two things: pain and glory. Each earns respect in near equal measure, so long as the pain is borne with stoicism. An Örkki with many scars who walks uncomplaining with a broken leg draws as much admiration as one who wins a great victory on the battlefield.",
						"Power in an Örkki hold comes from strength or family lineage. The structure tends to be feudal, with weaker Örkkis working at the behest of the strong. The Hold of Belkzen is the largest such society, and power changes hands there quickly. One mighty Örkki dying in battle can shake up an entire power structure, leading to squabbling and duels to decide control. Many Örkkis who tire of being subservient split off to form their own warbands, traveling to new territory.",
						"Young Örkkis are typically raised by the entire community. Indeed, it would be almost impossible for Örkkis to raise their young any other way, since twins, triplets, and even quadruplets are quite common in Örkki families, as are deaths among Örkkis in their child-rearing years. Many Örkki holds conduct ceremonies when a young Örkki comes of age, typically around their tenth or eleventh birthday, during which the new adults are told what their role in the hold will be. For communities that practice ritual scarification or tattooing, this is often when the young Örkkis receive their first hold-scar or tattoo as well.",
						"Örkkis fear very little, but most distrust magic. Magic is seen as a tool that bypasses the physical and allows the weak to contend with the strong, a belief that runs at odds with Örkki values. While they respect the physical might of Gorumite warpriests, and even druids who take on the forms of great beasts, they find arcane and occult magic questionable at best and unethical on the whole. All but the most depraved Örkki communities see necromancy as a foul art that steals glory from the dead, and their growing struggles against the undead have given them newfound common ground with their humanoid neighbors."

						"A common Örkki saying is, \"You are the scars that shape you.\" Violent, chaotic lives in violent, chaotic lands mean that most Örkkis tend heavily toward chaotic alignments. Gorum, Lamashtu, and Rovagug are all commonly worshiped among Örkki communities, though less violent holds worship nature deities like Gozreh or gods like Sarenrae, whose tenets of fire, redemption, and glory all hold some appeal to Örkki sensibilities.",
						"While there are Örkki deities, their worship is surprisingly uncommon among Örkkis. Örkkis believe that if a creature has a face and a name, it can be killed, and so their own deities are targets, rather than objects of reverence. Some Örkki holds teach that the greatest members of the hold can earn a chance to challenge the Örkki deities for a place amid the pantheon. Most Örkkis don't waste their dying moments praising the divine or praying for a place in the afterlife, but spitting a bloodflecked warning at their deities, promising a new challenger through broken teeth."
