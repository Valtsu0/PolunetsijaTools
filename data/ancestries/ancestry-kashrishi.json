						"Sarvellinen are able to get a vague sense of the current emotional state of others within 15 feet of them. This manifests as a general feeling of happiness, anger, or fear, without any specific details. For those with whom Sarvellinen have an emotional connection, physical touch can heighten this sense to greater degrees of detail and understanding, increasing with the strength of their bond. This also functions as an imprecise sense alerting you to the presence, but not the precise location, of non-mindless creatures within the area. You gain a +2 circumstance bonus on {@skill Perception} checks to {@action Sense Motive} against non-mindless creatures within the area of your empathic sense."

				"Sarvellinen make their homes in remote areas of the world. These quiet beings have stout, durable frames and distinctive crystalline horns. Their inherent psychic abilities make them natural empaths but also occasionally burden them with the unceasing thoughts of their neighbors."

				"Sarvellinen occupy a unique evolutionary branch native to the lands bordering the northern stretches of the Obari Ocean. Resembling halfling-sized bipedal rhinoceroses with the occasional odd insectile feature, Sarvellinen adapt to their environs with unusual efficiency, using a combination of rapid physical evolutions and inherent psychic powers. Sarvellinen are often mistakenly referred to as having hive minds, though they're actually natural empaths, capable of discerning a creature's emotional state and impulses through proximity. This near-oracular behavior occasionally leads to misunderstandings with humanoids who think a Sarvellinen is reading their thoughts or otherwise magically influencing the conversation, though peoples more familiar with Sarvellinen come to value their unique insights and intuitive diplomacy.",
				"Sarvellinen have an atypical level of control over their physical forms, thanks to their psychic powers, and can evolve new features over the course of a single generation. Typically, these features are intentionally cultivated to help deal with a particular environmental obstacle, such as a change in weather patterns, or if an invasive species affects available food supplies near their settlements.",
				"Sarvellinen often tailor their evolutions to match the most successful creatures in their environment. Whether a testament to the resilience of insects or simply a quirk of their environment, many Sarvellinen evolutions are directly inspired by creatures like the rhinoceros beetle or giant water bug.",
				"If you want a character that's visually distinct, able to naturally access the occult powers of the mind, and great at quickly making friends wherever they go, you should play a Sarvellinen.",

						"Sarvellinen have short but wide frames with remarkable strength for their size. All have signature crystalline horns, though these can grow in a variety of configurations. The most common Sarvellinen, xyloshis, have a large primary horn and between one and three smaller horns, typically arranged linearly from the tip of their nose and spanning along their nose and brow.",
						"While most Sarvellinen have light sandy or gray skin tones, their coloration can also echo the tones of their crystalline horns; sapphire, ruby, or emerald patterns aren't so uncommon as to cause another Sarvellinen to take notice. Sarvellinen with strong connections to specific creatures with whom they share their home environments might take on skin patterns or colorations that mirror those creatures. Some stories even talk about Sarvellinen with wings and butterfly patterns that cover their bodies, though no such Sarvellinen has been seen in the Impossible Lands for at least a century."

						"Most Sarvellinen never become adventurers, content in their remote homes. Those Sarvellinen who do become adventurers often do so from necessity after being conscripted by pirates or washed away to distant locales by tropical storms. Occasionally, more adventurous Uimari and Hehkuva Sarvellinen intentionally leave their islands to either found new colonies or to seek adventure. Any Sarvellinen might also take on the adventuring lifestyle in response to overcrowding on their home island.",
						"Sarvellinen rely on their inherent occult powers to ward off monsters, and they use their inherent empathic abilities to form bonds with allies. Sarvellinen make natural {@class bard||bards}, {@class champion||champions}, and {@class psychic|DA|psychics}. Typical Sarvellinen backgrounds include the {@background artist}, {@background emissary}, {@background fortune teller}, and {@background herbalist} backgrounds."

						"Sarvellinen communities welcome visitors and happily host all kinds of guests. Despite their welcoming nature, Sarvellinen settlements are often relieved when visits from larger groups, such as merchant ships and other trading vessels, end. Most humanoids take few precautions to conceal their thoughts and emotions, so a Sarvellinen might hardly distinguish even the politest ship crew from a barge full of rowdy pirates."

						"Despite their small stature, Sarvellinen tend to be terrible at hiding. Their crystalline horns are likely to flare with magical light when they exercise their innate magical powers, and they're raised in an environment where their parents or guardians can almost always find them by feeling for their emotions. As a result, Sarvellinen tend to be excessively honest and kind, avoiding harmful deceptions but also employing enough tact to ensure they don't evoke unpleasant emotional reactions from others.",
						"Sarvellinen lack a clear concept of charity, not because they're cruel or inconsiderate, but rather because their worldview is inherently inclusive of the people around them. Rare indeed is the Sarvellinen who exercises casual cruelty or who leaves another member of the community in need. Such actions lead to emotional reactions that cause turmoil for all Sarvellinen in the vicinity.",
						"Sarvellinen enjoy various team games, employing games of trivia as measures of both knowledge and psychic ability. They also appreciate games that involve bluffs and double-bluffs with blind cards, testing their abilities to keep their minds clear and their thoughts organized. Sarvellinen don't generally condone the act of gambling with outsiders, as many find it challenging to deal with the implications of their psychic abilities, even if they strive to keep their powers secret.",
						"Sarvellinen generally engage in monogamous relationships with no real preference toward any particular gender pairing. The height of intimacy for a Sarvellinen is opening their mind fully to the psychic link of another Sarvellinen, an act much more personal than anything physical. This act doesn't let Sarvellinen know whether someone is perfectly compatible with them or that the two mesh entirely\u2014simply that from moment to moment, their inner feelings are more accessible and open, so communication becomes not a guessing game but an entirely wholesome, true experience. Some Sarvellinen believe that psychic communication should be held exclusively for these intimate moments.",
						"Sarvellinen can be found in small groups on the island of Jalmeray and in larger communities occupying the many smaller islands surrounding it. Sarvellinen in the Inner Sea region rarely venture beyond the Impossible Lands, though some of their oldest stories speak of a harrowing voyage across the Obari Ocean when their kind fled some long-past disaster",
						"Sarvellinen have no natural enemies. They host pirates and merchants with equal hospitality, so long as that hospitality is respected by their guests. While Sarvellinen are exceptionally tolerant of the quirks and foibles of other species, they draw a hard line at anyone bringing outside conflicts into their communities. More than one canny pirate captain docks their ship at a Sarvellinen island after a particularly heated conflict, knowing the pirate hunters and military vessels seeking them won't encroach on Sarvellinen lands. Escaped criminals hoping to find a new lease on life might also hide in a Sarvellinen community, doing whatever they can to assist their hosts until whoever is hunting them gives up the chase."

						"Sarvellinen can worship any god, and they often lean toward deities most commonly worshipped in Jalmeray (page 180), but most Sarvellinen don't feel the need for religion. Sarvellinen communities are so deeply connected through their empathic and psychic links that religion is often considered superfluous. Religion tends to have specific benefits in a community: care for the poor, unifying and teaching community morals, providing gathering spaces, and such. Almost all of these functions come inherently to Sarvellinen, thanks to the hive-like nature of their empathic communication."

						"Most people on Golarion beyond the island of Jalmeray aren't aware Sarvellinen exist. Jalmeri humans might trade with Sarvellinen, and they might hire Kiipeilijä scouts to staff the crow's nests of their ships or Teräsniska warriors to serve as guards; however, people beyond Jalmeray's borders and shipping lanes are likely to mistake a Sarvellinen as a magical experiment or even an extraplanar visitor. While such misunderstandings can make Sarvellinen targets for ignorant villagers afraid of the unknown, the halfling-sized rhinos usually have the diplomatic skills to safely extricate themselves before situations turn violent."
