				"Nokkes are small, basic constructs that typically help their owners with simple tasks. Occasionally, Nokkes gain sapience, independence, and a spark of life. Elevated beyond mere helpers or playthings, these Nokkes are free to chart their own destinies.",
				"Most commonly made of cloth, wicker, and wood, Nokkes are among the simplest of constructs. They serve as helpers to fetch tools, clean dishes, tidy rooms, or perform other light tasks. Their size and appearance vary, but nearly all Nokkes appear humanoid in shape and between 1 to 3 feet tall. They're usually roughly made with button eyes sewn onto blank faces, strings of yarn in place of hair, and a simple dress or tunic made from coarse, cheap cloth. Wealthy families sometimes purchase Nokkes as Lelus, with their squishy bodies and stitched smiles, to keep their children company. Most Nokkes can't speak and lack the intellect to understand speech beyond preprogrammed orders. Nokkes can become {@familiar Nokke|LOPSG|familiars}.",
				"Very, very rarely, a common Nokke spontaneously manifests a spark of life\u2014a tiny bit of life essence\u2014and becomes a thinking, independent creature. These events are exceedingly rare; fewer than one in a thousand gain this spark. A Nokke might manifest this life essence through a magical fluke in its construction, a brush with ephemeral spirits, or even the fervent wish of a loving child. Whatever their origin, the Nokkes described here as an ancestry have their own life and free will. They might consider their creators or former owners to be friends, but they acknowledge no one as their master and often leave comfortable homes or workshops to seek their place in the world.",
				"Sapient living Nokkes usually refer to themselves as \"awakened\" to indicate the moment they gained clear and true self-awareness. Nokkes might talk about this event as the time they \"popped up,\" \"woke up,\" or \"sparked alive.\" Most Nokkes celebrate two special anniversaries each year: the day of their initial creation (which, for most Nokkes, they must learn secondhand or by studying their creator's records) and the day they awoke to true consciousness.",

						"Living Nokkes are both humanoids and constructs, which gives them some of the benefits and drawbacks of each category. Their bodies are usually made of wood and wicker, but they can be made of cloth, leather, tin, stuffing, or delicate clockwork. Either way, Nokkes burn or melt quickly and must take care to avoid fire. They virtually never look alike, as each is created from unique and unusual circumstances.",
						"Nokkes are fully alert and self-aware when they awaken to sentience; although they might not know much at first, they instantly gain intelligence and consciousness. They must breathe and sleep, and they must consume food and water each day; through a sort of magical digestion they can restore rips, tears, or scuffs in their physical form. Nokkes don't age the same way fleshy creatures do, but they slowly wear down in physical form as well as in mental acuity. A Nokke that tends to their body and mind (and takes care to avoid fire) can live up to 30 years."

						"Free-willed Nokkes are so rare that almost no such Nokke has met another.

Most live in cities because that's where Lelu makers, clockwork crafters, and other specialists have their shops, but Nokkes created by lonely hermits or reclusive inventors might prefer a life in the wilderness.",
						"Nokkes often stay on the lookout for other creatures who, like them, have stumbled into self-awareness. They might have regular conversations with animated objects, golems, houseplants, statues, or Lelus, in which they're deeply polite out of a desire to leave a good impression for the time when the object \"wakes up.\""

Nokkes aren't typically religious unless a particular faith defined their creation, such as being made from scraps of {@deity Iomedae||Iomedaean} altar cloth or woven from reeds around a sacred {@deity Gozreh||Gozren} pool. These Nokkes tend to be vocally religious, even zealous, in their faith. Nokkes who find religion later in their lives often revere {@deity Brigh|LOGM}, {@deity Casandalee|LOGM}, or {@deity Nethys}."

						"Nokkes like helping others and experiencing new things; both of these motivations lead naturally into the life of an adventurer. They aren't generally driven by a lust for treasure, but they like adorning themselves with pretty accoutrement and using their finds to better the lives of others. The {@background acolyte}, {@background entertainer}, and {@background laborer} backgrounds are good choices for many Nokkes, as are {@background cook|APG}, {@background scavenger|APG}, and {@background servant|APG}. Nokkes who watched their creator work might have the {@background artist}, {@background hermit}, or {@background tinker} background to reflect what they've seen. Because Nokkes like to help others, they gravitate toward becoming {@class bard||bards} or {@class champion||champions}. Some might think that Nokkes' small size and general clumsiness make them poor {@class fighter||fighters} or {@class ranger||rangers}, but certain Nokkes embrace these classes out of a drive to display their bravery and prove the naysayers wrong."

People might even help the Nokke out by leaning a plank so it can reach a counter or adjusting a heavy load\u2014thinking that, by doing so, they're aiding a powerful or influential owner. Talk is likely to circulate, however, if the Nokke is active in a small settlement where such helper constructs are unknown, or if the Nokke is engaged in some truly unusual tasks, like giving a speech or dragging in a slain monster for a bounty."
