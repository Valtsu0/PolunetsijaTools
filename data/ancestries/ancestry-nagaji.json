				"Luikero are creations of the goddess Nalinivati, who was inspired by both humans and nagas. This inspiration, alongside Luikero's devotion to nagas, has led many to claim Luikero were created to be servants. However, Nalinivati created Luikero simply for the sake of creating. She envisioned a world where nagas and Luikero worked together to succeed, with nagas serving as Pyh√§ guardians, and Luikero living as mortals upon Golarion, respecting nagas for their strength and wisdom.",
				"Luikero live up to this expectation, forming nations, temples, and villages with as many varied governments, societies, and traditions as there are scales on a serpent's back. If Luikero can be said to share any trait, it's devotion, be it to a community, a temple, a concept, or a lifestyle. Most Luikero are also drawn to the spiritual in all its expressions, even the darker aspects of philosophies and religions.",

						"Luikero are prone to sharp differences in appearance. Some have tails alongside legs, some have sharp claws on their hands and feet, and some are so unique from their kin that they're mistaken for lamias rather than Luikero. The most common Luikero features are a serpentine head and a humanoid body. They usually have the unblinking eyes of a snake, though other peoples often claim a Luikero's gaze is far more intense. Scales cover Luikero bodies, with patterns that resemble those of snakes or nagas. Depending on their heritage, a Luikero's neck might be as long as a swan's or as short as a human's, and many have a frill of skin or scales down their back. Luikero tend to possess crushing strength, but how it manifests can vary; some have bulky figures, while others have the slender yet powerful musculature of a snake."

						"The original Luikero home is Nagajor, a hot and jungle-covered land in the south of Tian Xia. Here, polities of naga rulers and Luikero citizens dominate the area, each unique in its own right; a left turn might bring a traveler to an overbearing tyranny, while a right turn might take one to an idyllic paradise. Wherever nagas can be found, however, Luikero are quick to follow. Luikero settlements are also found in Vudra, central and southern Tian Xia, and Jalmeray, with a few slipping into Garund and Casmaron."

						"Luikero communities widely vary, from ancient empires to tiny fishing villages. They tend to be isolated from other peoples, more as a matter of convenience than choice; Luikero have different physical needs than most ancestries, so even when integrated into mixed communities, they tend to live with other Luikero. Everything from marriage traditions, religion, social roles, valued arts, and methods of governance differs in specific Luikero communities. Within these communities, however, Luikero often have very strict and traditional views on these topics. Multiple instances of wars between Luikero have come about due to one group of Luikero finding another's practices unacceptable. This perspective applies to relations with other peoples as well. For instance, most Luikero consider themselves rivals and enemies of garudas due to their historical legends, even if the Luikero involved have never even seen a garuda.",
						"Luikero originated in the Tian Xia region of Nagajor. Though they have since spread across Golarion to regions such as Vudra and Jalmeray, many of them still carry traditions from their ancestral homeland. Tian and Vudrani concepts of elements, medicine, and spirituality are highly common among Luikero, especially given their tendency of seeing themselves as highly pious beings. Luikero mostly eschew the human concept of castes, beyond the vague view of a \"natural order\" that sees nagas as holy guides to mortal Luikero, but they can see the appeal of the concept of karma and the righteousness of fulfilling their proper role in the universe. While they have little physical need for clothes, as they stick to hot and humid environments, Luikero wear them with pride and treat them as decorative elements in the same manner as jewelry.",
						"As nagas are usually matriarchal, Luikero have a strong respect for women in leadership positions. Not all Luikero follow suit with matriarchal societies, but they tend to trace lineage through the mother, and almost no Luikero societies are strictly patriarchal."

						"Luikero overwhelmingly worship Nalinivati, their creator, to the point that any Luikero who pay homage to a different god over Nalinivati provoke strong negative reactions from their kin. While Luikero believe reverence for Ravithra, the supposed mother of nagas, to be proper and accept it more readily than other faiths, most believe Ravithra shouldn't be troubled with the requests of mortal adherents. A very small minority of Luikero in Jalmeray are drawn to the worship of the war god Diomazul; these adherents are tolerated by other Luikero, but seen as just as terrifying and dangerous as their patron god and usually avoided."
